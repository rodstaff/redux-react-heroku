# redux-react-heroku

<p>"Redux-React-Routes" is coded in ReactJS + React-Router and using the Redux framework.  It is a playful presentation of some famous people and the Mutant Ninja Turtles!  The app's simplicity betrays the complexity behind it.  It is a combination of multiple tutorials and it serves as a personal template for bigger and more complex apps.  There were four challenges I faced creating this app: <br/> 

(1) It is on the "bleeding edge" of technology and can be overwhelming;<br/>
(2) Online authors do not necessarily make sure your dev environment is working or assume it is already working;<br/>
(3) Different authors have different coding styles and preferences and explain only snippets of their total code.  Their code repositories may also be outdated.
(4) Deployment to Heroku is a pain!!!</p><br/>
